-- Rust - 80:100 What C++ should've been
-- Julia - 70:100 Python, if Python was good
My favourite language to solve Advent of Code puzzles with.
Pluto.jl is fantastic!
-- C - 50:10
I respect C, but I generally prefer to avoid writing new software in it.
-- C++ - 50:0
I understand why people prefer C++ over C, but RAII feels tacked-on and other languages implement it far better.
-- JavaScript - 95:30
Type annotations are entirely necessary for good JavaScript, but JSDoc is terrible syntax. Why not just use TypeScript?
-- TypeScript - 85:70 Fixes as many of JavaScript's mistakes as it can
But it's still far from perfect.
-- Go - 30:10
